# Pobal

Pobal is a mobile-web-first network companion for consultants and relationship-driven professionals.

The application helps users:

- manage people and company records;
- capture meeting notes and voice updates;
- structure relationship intelligence with AI;
- track follow-ups and commitments;
- identify network matches and introduction opportunities;
- prepare for meetings using relationship memory;
- maintain a migration-ready SaaS foundation.

## Source of truth

The product and engineering source of truth is:

- [`/docs/product/network-companion-final-build-brief.md`](docs/product/network-companion-final-build-brief.md)

Codex and all contributors must also follow:

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`/docs/development/codex-operating-model.md`](docs/development/codex-operating-model.md)
- [`/docs/development/initial-codex-task.md`](docs/development/initial-codex-task.md)
- ADRs in [`/docs/decisions`](docs/decisions)

## Intended architecture

Initial V1 target:

```text
Next.js App Router + TypeScript
PostgreSQL + Prisma + pgvector
OpenAI provider adapter for AI and transcription
Hosted initially on Vercel + Neon
Migration-ready for Azure Container Apps + Azure Database for PostgreSQL
```

## Important product constraints

- Mobile web is the primary UX.
- Desktop is secondary and used for heavier management workflows.
- AI can propose updates but must not mutate core records without user confirmation.
- LinkedIn integration is manual user-provided enrichment only.
- The app must remain portable and Docker-compatible.
- External providers must be accessed through internal adapters.

## First Codex task

Use the task in:

- [`/docs/development/initial-codex-task.md`](docs/development/initial-codex-task.md)

Do **not** ask Codex to build the full application in one step.

## Manual repository upload

If uploading this pack manually through GitHub, upload the full folder contents to the root of the `Creaboobot/Pobal` repository and commit them. Then start Codex with the prompt in `FIRST_CODEX_PROMPT.md`.
